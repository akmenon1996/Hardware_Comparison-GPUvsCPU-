# Harware_Comparison-GPUvsCPU-
Class project for class CSYE 7374 where I am building a ML model to predict the name of the artist given the image of the painting. The goal of the course involves comparison of training the model across various hardware configurations and testing the training efficiency.

The best model was trained on the Google Colab Pro. The link to which is here:[Colab Repository Link](https://github.com/akmenon1996/Harware_Comparison-GPUvsCPU-/blob/master/train_model(Colab_GPU).ipynb)


Shout out to [Supratim Haldar](https://supratimh.github.io/) for the baseline machine learning model code on top of which I built for comparisons across hardware.
