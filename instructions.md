To generate the hdf5 file of the trained model,follow the following steps. 
1. Open the [Colab Repository Link](https://github.com/akmenon1996/Harware_Comparison-GPUvsCPU-/blob/master/train_model(Colab_GPU).ipynb)
to the model exploratory analysis and ML model. 
2. Gather data from this Kaggle link[(Kaggle - Best artwork of all time)](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) '
and store it on your google drive account.'
3. Replace my drive's local addresses with the data's address in your drive. 
4. Enable GPU in your Hardware configurations for faster training. 
5. Once the model is done training completely, collect the latest trained model from the model_checkpoints folder 
in the best-artworks-ofall-time directory. 
6. Store this hdf5 file in the models folder of [this repository](https://github.com/akmenon1996/Artwork-artist-prediction-webapp) 
to run the web app successfully.
